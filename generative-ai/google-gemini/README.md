## Foundations of Prompt Thinking

🚀 0️⃣ Phase 0: Foundations of Prompt Thinking (Beginner)

🎯 Goal: Understand what prompt engineering is, how LLMs think, and build intuition.

📘 What to Learn

What is a prompt, completion, context, temperature, tokens.

Types of AI models (GPT, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA).

How LLMs interpret language and patterns.

Prompt formats: instruction → context → examples → output.

Common prompt errors (ambiguity, verbosity, missing context).

⚙️ Practice Tasks

Ask ChatGPT to explain a topic at different difficulty levels.

Rewrite one prompt 3 ways (simple → detailed → structured).

Experiment with temperature 0.1 vs 0.9 and compare outputs.

🏁 Milestone

✅ You can create prompts that consistently return relevant, on-topic responses.

🧩 1️⃣ Phase 1: Structured Prompt Crafting

🎯 Goal: Learn frameworks and design patterns for building effective prompts.

📘 What to Learn

Prompt structures:

Role Prompting: “You are a cybersecurity expert…”

Chain-of-Thought Prompting: “Let’s reason step-by-step.”

Few-Shot Prompting: show examples before task.

Zero-Shot vs One-Shot prompting.

Context windows & information control.

Output formatting (Markdown, JSON, tables).

⚙️ Practice Tasks

Build prompts for:

Summarization in a specific tone.

Data extraction to JSON.

Creative rewriting (story → tweet → poem).

Use few-shot examples for consistent formatting.

🏁 Milestone

✅ You can design prompts that produce repeatable, structured, and style-controlled outputs.
